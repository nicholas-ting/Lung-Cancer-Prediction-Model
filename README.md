# Lung-Cancer-Prediction-Model  
## Project Overview

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death globally, with a significant number of cases diagnosed at advanced stages. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial in improving treatment outcomes and patient survival rates. This project aims to enhance the precision and efficiency of lung cancer diagnosis using machine learning (ML), thereby improving treatment outcomes and reducing operational expenses for healthcare providers.

## Background

Lung cancer's high prevalence and the socio-economic costs associated with late diagnoses present a compelling case for innovative solutions. Traditional diagnostic methods are manual, time-consuming, and often result in misdiagnoses. Machine learning offers a promising avenue to automate and improve the diagnostic process, potentially saving lives and optimizing healthcare resources.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a proof of concept (POC) using machine learning techniques to:
- Detect the existence of benign or malignant tumors.
- Determine the extent and stage of cancer.
- Provide targeted treatment options based on demographic data and imagery.

## Approach

Our approach involves utilizing machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest, MARS, and Convolutional Neural Networks) to analyze symptomatic, demographical, and imaging data. The models will be evaluated for accuracy, stability, and their ability to predict lung cancer presence and stage effectively.

## Data Sources

This project will leverage datasets from Kaggle, including patient data linked to air pollution and comprehensive lung cancer imaging datasets. These datasets will form the basis of our ML model training and validation processes.

## Potential Impact

By automating the initial stages of lung cancer screening and diagnosis, our solution aims to:
- Reduce the high rate of false positives in current screening methods.
- Decrease the time from imaging to diagnosis, critical in improving patient outcomes.
- Minimize the need for specialist intervention, democratizing access to diagnostic capabilities in low-resource settings.
